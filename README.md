# Algorithms Stanford University â€” Tim Roughgarden
This is my answer for algorithms specialization by stanford Professor Tim Roughgarden.

The specialization has four part: Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms; Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures; Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees and Dynamic Programming; 
Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them. 

First part finished in Python at March 13, 2019.

When on work, my language is C and I'll turn to finish this course in C. 7/23/2019
